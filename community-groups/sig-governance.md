# SIG Roles and Organizational Governance

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Konveyor governance](https://github.com/konveyor/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).
It will be updated as needed to meet the current needs of the Konveyor project.

In order to standardize Special Interest Group efforts, create maximum
transparency, and route contributors to the appropriate SIG, SIGs should follow
these guidelines:

- Have an approved Charter [SIG charter process]
- Meet regularly, at least for 30 minutes every 3 weeks, except during holidays
- Keep up-to-date meeting notes, linked from the SIG's page in the community
repo
- Report activity with the community via the konveyor-community@googlegroups.com mailing list at
least once a year. 
- Each SIG provides updates regularly on the Konveyor community meeting, atleast once a month.  
- Participate in release planning meetings and retrospectives, and burndown
meetings, as needed
- Ensure related work happens in a project-owned github org and repository, with
 code and tests explicitly owned and supported by the SIG, including issue
 triage, PR reviews, test-failure response, bug fixes, etc.
- Use the [forums provided](https://github.com/konveyor/community#communication) as the primary means of working, communicating, and
collaborating, as opposed to private emails and meetings  
- Ensure contributing instructions (CONTRIBUTING.md) are defined in the SIGs
folder located in the [Konveyor/community](https://github.com/konveyor/community) repo if the groups contributor steps
and experience are different or more in-depth than the documentation listed in
the general [contributor guide](https://github.com/konveyor/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  
- Track and identify all SIG features in the current release and [konveyor/enhancements](https://github.com/konveyor/enhancements)

The process for setting up a SIG or Working Group (WG) is listed in the
[sig-wg-lifecycle] document.

## Roles

### Notes on Roles

Within this section "Lead" refers to someone who is a member of the union
of a Chair, or Tech Lead role. Leads have specific decision making power over some
part of a group and thus additional accountability. Each role is detailed below.  


#### Activity Expectations  

- Leads *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
- Leads taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with other leads to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
- Leads going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other Leads to identify a temporary replacement.
- Leads of a role *SHOULD* remove any other leads or roles that have not communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1 month or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1 month.
  - This may be done through a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of Leads. If there are not enough *active* Leads, then a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote between Chairs and Tech Leads may decide the removal of the Lead.

#### Requirements

- Leads *MUST* be at least a ["member" on our contributor ladder](https://github.com/konveyor/community/blob/main/contributor_ladder.md) to
be eligible to hold a leadership role within a SIG.
- SIGs *MAY* prefer various levels of domain knowledge depending on the
role. This should be documented in the [Konveyor/community](https://github.com/konveyor/community) SIG folders.

#### Escalations

- Lead membership disagreements *MAY* be escalated to the SIG Chairs. SIG Chair
membership disagreements may be escalated to the Steering Committee.

#### On-boarding and Off-boarding Leads

- Leads *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and propose a replacement.  Use
lazy consensus amongst other Leads with fallback on majority vote to accept
proposal.  The candidate *SHOULD* be supported by a majority of SIG contributors.
- Leads *MAY* select additional leads through a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote
amongst leads. This *SHOULD* be supported by a majority of SIG contributors.
