# Adding a new member to the Konveyor GitHub Org

This procedure outlines the steps to add someone to the Konveyor GitHub
organization.

## Membership Requirements

All members of the Kubernetes GitHub org are required to do the following:

- Have 2FA enabled on their GitHub account

  This is enforced by GitHub. The contributor will not be able to accept the org
  invitation without it, and they will be removed from the org automatically in
  the event they disable it.

- Join the  [Konveyor.io mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/konveyorio) & 
  [konveyor-community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/konveyor-community)

- List their active contributions

- List the active subprojects they are involved in

## Sponsor Requirements

We rely on sponsors to vouch for the work of
the prospective new member, and to validate the work they are doing.

In order to qualify as a sponsor, the requirements are:

- Sponsors must be a member of the Konveyor GH org.

- Sponsors must be a reviewer or approver in at least one of the Konveyor SIGs/Individual projects

- Sponsors must have close interactions with the prospective member

  Sponsors need to be familiar enough with the prospective member's
  contributions to be able to properly vouch for them. This is to ensure
  integrity in the membership process, and a "web of trust" for the privileges
  we afford members.

## Processing the request

Once all the requirements have been validated, one of the Konveyor Maintainers will 
add the new members to Konveyor GH org.
