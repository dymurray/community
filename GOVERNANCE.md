# Governance 


## Konveyor Governance

Konveyor's mission is to establish a community of people passionate about helping others modernize and migrate their applications to the hybrid cloud by building tools and best practices on how to replatform and refactor applications to run on Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies

The community is focused on building the ultimate Open Source toolkit to help organizations safely migrate and modernize their application portfolio to leverage Kubernetes, providing differential value on each stage of the adoption process


## Community Groups

Konveyor project consists of various Special Interest Groups AKA SIGs. Konveyor SIGs are based on Kubernetes SIGs. 

### Special Interest Groups

Each SIG in the Konveyor project pertains to advancing the project in a specific area, like Core components or UI. Each SIG will be led by two or three co-chairs. Initial bootstrapping of the SIGs will be led by a chair appointed by the Konveyor Maintainers. As the members move through the contributor ladder, they will be eligible to be a co-chair after they have been a maintainer for 3-6 months. Konveyor steering committee will vote on the co-chair nominations.  

## Contributor Participation

Members, Reviewers, and Approvers are defined in the [Konveyor Contributor Ladder](https://github.com/konveyor/community/blob/main/contributor_ladder.md).  

### Governance Requirements

Konveyor is required to have "open" governance of some kind.  Open governance is defined by the following principles:

1. The governance structure is fully documented in a GOVERNANCE file.
2. All regular contributors are eligible to be project members, regardless of employer, nationality, or other characteristics.
3. Most meetings or discussions of project leadership are open to all project members.
4. Leadership positions are held by individuals, not companies.
5. All project members are eligible for advancement within the project based on clearly defined criteria.
6. All project members who meet clearly defined leadership criteria are eligible for leadership positions.
7. There is a defined cadence of leadership replacement, annually or more frequently.
8. Governance rules are modifiable by project leaders through a defined process.
9. The project adopts, and adheres to, the Code of Conduct.


Should a member of the Approvers Committee cease being active in the project, violate the Code Of Conduct, or need to be removed for some other reason, they may be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of the other Committee members, or a vote of the Steering Committee.

## Konveyor Steering Committee

Konveyor is governed by a Steering Committee, which is selected as follows:

* One representative from each Konveyor SIGs
* One overall "Maintainer(Approver) Representative"
* One or two overall "Member Representative"
* The Steering committee should contain at least 7 members, if there are fewer than 4 SIGs, the remaining seats will be filled by member representatives

### Steering Committee Duties

The Steering Committee is responsible for the following tasks, any of which may be delegated to a person or group selected by the committee:


* Arbitrating inter-SIG disagreements
* Selecting the Code of Conduct Committee and ratifying CoC judgements
* Acting on escalated requests from security or code quality issues
* Administering Konveyor project infrastructure, intellectual property, and resources
* Determining overall direction for advocacy and marketing of Konveyor
* Resolving project issues that SIGs are unable to resolve
* Issue statements on behalf of Konveyor
* Reviewing and approving Contributor Ladder advancement for participants who work on the overall umbrella project

In performance of these duties, the Steering Committee will hold a monthly meeting that is open to all Members.  The Committee may hold additional, closed meetings in order to discuss non-public issues such as security exploits, CoC enforcement, and legal questions.  Decisions are confirmed if they receive the endorsement of a majority of Steering members, except where otherwise noted.

Steering Committee members are expected to advocate for all of Konveyor, not just certain projects or corporate sponsors, comply with and support the Code of Conduct, and be professional and compassionate in all of their dealings with project participants.

### Steering Committee Elections

The Maintainer Representative will be elected by the collective Approvers of all Konveyor repositories, as defined in the Contributor Ladder.  The Member representative will be elected by the collective Members of the Konveyor org, as defined in the Contributor Ladder.  These positions will be elected annually.

Once per year, the Steering Committee will select between one and three Election Officers to run the annual election and sets the dates for the election.  These officers will update the list of eligible Maintainers and Members according to project records, send out announcements, and conduct the election.  The election starts with a call for nominations, which lasts for at least one week, and will include a period for project Members to request changes to their voting status. Candidates may nominate themselves, or they may be nominated by their colleagues. 

The election itself will last for at least one week, and is conducted as a preference election online, using a method such as Condorcet or IRV.  The Election Officers will announce the selected candidates at the next regular community meeting.

### Steering Committee Bootstrapping

The maintainers of the Konveyor project will become the Steering Committee for a period of two years, afterwards Steering Committee elections will proceed as outlined in this
document. 

## Governance Amendments

The Konveyor Community may adopt or amend its Governance
Documents (`GOVERNANCE.md` and `contributor-ladder.md`) according to
the following process:

1. Propose a change by opening an issue in the community, and if there
   seems to be general agreement, open a pull request to this document.
2. The change should be announced via the mailing list along with an invitation for discussion on the Pull Request.
3. A minimum of 7 days must pass between the announcement and the vote,
   and the vote must remain open for a minimum of 7 days. The Steering
   Committee may extend both periods.

For a vote to pass, 2/3 majority of the Steering Committee must approve.


## Code of Conduct Committee

In order to review and enforce the Code Of Conduct, the Steering Committee selects three to five people to be on the Code of Conduct Committee.  These individuals will be chosen based on their experience in community management and conduct issues, and to represent a diversity of viewpoints, including employer, gender, race, and region of the world.  To avoid fatigue, the Steering Committee will replace at least one member of the CoC Committee each year.  Members of the committee do not need to be members of Konveyor if they have sufficient other expertise.

The CoC Committee will receive reports of conduct violations confidentially, and will discuss them in closed meetings.  If a report is determined to be a violation, they will recommend action on it appropriate to the scale, nature, and context of the violation, from requiring an apology, up to expulsion of an individual from the project.  In the event that a contributor is to be demoted or expelled, the CoC Committee will forward this recommendation to the Steering Committee who will ratify it in a closed meeting.  Should a member of the Steering Committee be the offender, they will recuse themselves from that meeting.
