# Migration Experience User Group

This is a user group focused on improving application modernization by sharing problems and solutions so others facing similar future issues will be in a better position for success.  

The learnings from this group are of vital interest to Konveyor as all learnings will help the community to add more intelligence into the solution via expanding our [Rulesets](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets)

## How to participate
* Please join the email group: konveyor-ug-mig-exp@googlegroups.com
  * Join URL:  https://groups.google.com/g/konveyor-ug-mig-exp
* Please open issues in [konveyor/rulesets/issues](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets/issues) to share uses cases which may help for future rule development
* Or chat with us in kubernetes.slack.com:  (Get a slack invite via: https://slack.k8s.io/)
  * #[konveyor](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CR85S82A2): General questions and discussions
  * #[konveyor-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C04QZJFQ0UA): Konveyor development related discussions

## Rule improvements
The Konveyor Community is actively seeking help in gathering knowledge of modernization issues across all problem domains (even for languages/technologies we do not as yet support).

This help can be as simple as opening an issue in [konveyor/rulesets/issues](https://github.com/konveyor/rulesets/issues) and sharing a scenario you encountered.  No prior knowledge of Konveyor and/or Rules development is necessary.  The development team will gladly handle the drafting of rules from any content shared.  With your help Konveyor will expand it’s pool of shared knowledge so the pains you face today will be brought back into the rules and ease future modernization journeys.


## Possible Areas of Interest (yet open to much more than this)
* Areas of interest to expand for Rules coverage
    * .Net framework to .Net
    * Legacy Java
        * Traditional Application Server (Java EE/Jakarta EE) to Quarkus or Spring Boot
        * Netflix OSS to Kubernetes
        * Distributed Cache setups in VM to running on Kubernetes
        * Service discovery (Consul/Eureka/Zookeeper) to Kubernetes
        * Session Management
        * Configuration Management patterns in K8s
        * HA (native clustering) to Kubernetes
        * Coupling with APIs from other container platforms to Kubernetes
  
All scenarios are desired, even for technologies we don’t yet cover.  The above is just a glimpse of potential areas of interest
